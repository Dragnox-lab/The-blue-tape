I inherited Weakness courage scars and wounds

Pain love cold blood and blue moon

Heart that stitches and heart that can't be stitched

 Hatred words rhymes and blue tunes</div>
 <div id="f" class="poem">
Fertilizer I"ll take bullshit if thats all you got
Fertilizer come again oh she wants you alot
Fertilizer fertilizer
Fertilizer she can't explain feelings that I gave
Grew again that meaningful life she wanted to maintain
More alive her never been when she was with me so
I can't tell if I would walk her again down this road
Her survival cant be based on something way too small
Won't feel to escape if I got back in her claws
Oh fertilizer I can't be your savior just pause
I Got enough to leave you anytime If I want
More aligned her never with death for as I know
But I can't pull the drowning hand then wonder why I choked
Fertilizer I can't take any of your part
You take me drain me nourish yourself and tear me apart
More alive her never been when she was with me so
This fertilizer would let her free go have ur own thoughts
Fertilizer oh I can't take no bullshit anymore
Oh fertilizer I think u should throw away the cause

"INAUDIBLE"
"i feel umm sometimes actually most of times you whatever ur doing in ur life and yk its being
written in ur past but yk ur too deep in the moment like ur just i dont know how it put but its 
just what not to do and ur just going going and going until a moment when comes u have to face 
whatever u have been doing for a period of ur life and it kinda dosent feel good u have 2 ways 
either to acknowledge moralities and ur standards or moralities and feel guilt and run away from 
it because its easier or either to face it accept it and move on and get better but most people 
arent much conscious or honest to take a moment to not only reflect but intend new ways that 
align with their moralities but when one does it really breaks them when they sober of the
 minds highs"

 <div id="11" class="poem">
Can't start can't start who cares can't 

Here m waiting for me

Here m stuck between betweens

Well I say I think I think too much

You say I should just keep moving

Umm can't start wonder I wonder why

And now they won't just let me be

A family broken in variables

A family broke my everything

Uhh won't tell won't see won't hear again

Won't let you know if I started

Cant move reusue pain of mine

Can't think nothing but my dreams

So I can't start wonder I wonder why

  <div id="trance" class="poem">
There's truth in the silence there's love in her eyes
M feeling something that words can't describe 
I can not hide from her she can't be mine
I can't describe I felt pain in her voice
M feeling something more than just lies
I feel conflicted when I feel this vibe
I see u running away from ur past
No present no future would u love this trance
I saw her covering her hairs for his eyes
I saw her when she was blinded by lights 
I can not stress how much she was conflicted
I can't explain all the pain she was gifted
Those hallucinations when she aint sleep 2 nights
 those past 12 conversations we had that time
I told myself I would never again
But somewhere in my soul it does temptates
We were too close and then we fell apart
I did care for her more than with just heart
I loved when she hurt me I love those scars
My turns ran up too soon I thought it'd last 
There's truth in the silence theres love in her eyes
M feeling something that words can't describe 
There's truth in the silence where I do reside
And she often thinks of a word called "suicide"
Words can't describe words can't describe 
M feeling something that words can't describe

    <div id="walls" class="poem">
(walls do talk but i dont listen anymore
replay read again when u finish the song)
If These Walls Could Talk
they’d tell me to swim good.
No boat, I floated better than he would.
No life jacket — she has nothing to lose.
No life purpose, and it hurts 'cause I feel her bruise.
These walls have already broken their seal but let loose.
Walls telling me they won’t regret if I go deep.
And she dosent care his acknowledgment of it
But the landlord is not near right now
And she doesn’t seem to fear or care about his vow
Walls telling me they’re full of pain and resentment,
Need someone to live a fantasy and hide behind the curtain,
Need someone to fuck on every night.
I didn’t really know what’s wrong and what’s right,
So I let her in as long as I could.
I told her it's *** but she wanted to loose.
Go deep.
Four springs more, and I’d reach her age.
Back then I was in just some teenage phase.
She knew better — or maybe she didn’t.
But age don’t mean sense when the thrill’s addictive.
I was too immature, But it did mean somethin’.
If these walls could talk,
They’d beg for peace.
They’ve seen too much,
And they never sleep.
They’d tell you secrets.
They’d scream in grief. 
They’d ask you softly,
“Do you still believe?”
If these walls could talk,
They would still beg for more.
They tell me patterns still happen, but not as often.
Landlord still don’t know.
Wonder what he’d say
About the only one he cared or bragged about when you asked him…
And how she’s fuckin’ on a random Instagrammer.
Walls can talk.

 <div id="nympho" class="poem">
And it's burning out

 m referring drought

Sun jus way too up

my eyes can't look down

I could tell if she was along with me

Ion think that way i think she's using

I think m alone I think she's a fraud

ghost in silk disguise

i think her should die

Let my ego talk

There's a reason buh

I won't bear this shit

I don't think much but I think m hating

I think m being rational I think m being mean
 M being free

   <div id="ashu" class="poem">

felt alive when i felt alone

felt the vibe when ur in my zone

felt ur life cuz its what i adore

and i dont rlly know much more

i thought there wasnt anyone for me

when i was being blue again

and almost had no time to breath

remembered ur life its me again

like a bee to my flower u were jus my home

i thought there was no one like me in this world again 

then i remembered ur life again

 how can someone be so cruel to us 

how can someone be so rude for us 

how did u know u would find me cuz 

i didnt want to see you again

hearing ur life i felt so blue

i couldnt handle what i had on my own

i thought i must ditch u forever

but there was no one to hear my pain in vain

thought of u when i felt alone

felt alive when i felt alone

i think we should die together

cuz no one wanna hear us again

you are me and i am you

felt ur life and i felt so poured 

tears u wept running down my life

felt it all i swear to god

who you are i exactly know who you should i exactly know]

i think we should die again

and kill our dreams being free from soul

thought of u when i thought of me

felt alive again you see

i think v must die again to feel alive to feel some shame

buh being together is hard you see

cuz being together is forbidden

this world of god wont let us live

Or die together for all I know

 There is world for you 

there is world for me

there are words to say

there are promises to keep

even if it feels so wrong we must go on alone again

cuz being together is hard you see

cuz being together is forbidden

    Dear BLue

    to take the lies
    
    to hold the crisis
    
    u held me once
    
    and thought ur mine
    
    and i could tellur more alone
    
    and i could tell theres no one on the phone
    
    and i could tell u walk with dead souls
    
    and i could tell u don have ur own soul
    
    and i could tell who u pretend to be
    
    and i could tell who u think u is
    
    and i could tell u know it all
    
    but its jus way too hard to accept
    
    and i could tell u mold yourself
    
    and i could tell they never did once
    
    and i would feel when u fall so loud
    
    but m too busy walkin myself around
    
    maybe u don need anyone anymore
    
    maybe u don even need yourself
    
    because self of yours feels way too lost
    
    to be held to talked
    
     to be held to protect 
    
    so walk around with a soul so dead
    
    till flowers emerge where walls dont rest
    
    so talk around with the god of yours
    
    till self of yours emerge from shell

  <div id="tattoos" class="poem">
    (Disclamer: Its only a conceptual vere)
    tattoos and piercings queer love and sex

    drinking from her mouth sitting on his lap

    fuckin in public sorry my fucks done lost map

    its not my problem that ur perception is a trap

    no am not alike you yea i am that brat

    and just to remind you that " *** ** **** " 

    hold down to target cuz m an outsider

    hold down precisely m good at defiance

    and i am somewhere between these lines too

    caused some moral casualties sinning in high mood

    where did i come from? where did i go?

    where is cause cuz effect is all i know

    theres scars to run from theres reactions to prompt

    a seek for liberaltion or a middle finger to control

    cuz bitch its 25 m done with the old codes

    and sinning"s too forbidden my hands done devil hold

    cuz he's too outsider he relates for sure

    m wearing sin as a trophy

    till in hurt it does mold

    what is an advisor?somebody thats holdin my path 

    just to tell me how to proceed in this short life span

    the type of shit to make me get out and kill some 

    feel somethin get out your ways and demonstrate the 5th chunk

    my practice running from fear guess i had some  badluck

    at 27 years old my biggest fear was being judged

    how they look at me reflect on myself my family my city

    what they hear from me reveal how my reputation would miss me

    what see from me would make em used to this line 

    some people do accept they cuz don wanna get left behind 

    M talking fear 

    Fear losing god in me for pride

    Cuz my DNA would let me evolve in the light of drugs

    M talking fear

    Fear that my humbleness is gone

    M talking fear

    Fear worth ain't living here no more

    Fear 

    Fear that it is wickedness or weakness 

    Fear 

    whatever it is both is distinctive

    Fear

    what happens on earth stays on earth

    and i cant take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse

    with the trauma bags carried out me in hands

    wondering if m living through freedom or living through trends
